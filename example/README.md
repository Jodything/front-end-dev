Hello World!
------------

Thanks for being interested in our front end position. Due to the higher than expected number of applicants, we wanted to give you a chance to separate yourself.

Please seach the attached example image then attempt to recreate it from scratch. As in, write your own css in order to accomplish the project.

You've been given the necessary images in the /images directory and the appropriate colors are noted in the index.html file. Please don't write your css styles inline or in the actual index.html file. Instead, create a folder and reference them in the page.

Now, because this is about problem solving. If you want to do something cool with Yeoman or Grunt or any other cool system, go for it. Feel free to use some framework or templating language like Jade.

The point is to take the project and make it your own while still accomplishing the goal. And no, there's no penalty for not doing something different, it just helps us when you do!

***DISCLAIMER***

No, we're not going to use your code in anyway other than to evaluate you for potential hire. Thanks!
